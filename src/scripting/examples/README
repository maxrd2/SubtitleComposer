SUBTITLE COMPOSER SCRIPTING README
==================================

There's currently no real documentation but the examples and the included API
(see 'api' directory) should give you enough information to get started.

Besides the corresponding interpreter framework and Kross defined modules (i18n,
forms, etc.), scripts can access some modules specific to Subtitle Composer that
provide methods to access global objects, enum values and/or create other objects:

ranges:
	contains methods to create ranges and ranges lists, including a range list
	describing the current selection ranges.

strings:
	contains only one method for creating styled string objects and provides
	access to the StyleFlag enum values, used to get/set styling information
	(see SString class *StyleFlag* methods).

subtitle:
	contains methods to access the subtitle instance and query the translation
	mode state (true when there's an open translation, false otherwise). It also
	provides access to TextTarget enum values, used to specify the target (primary
	text, secondary text/translation, or both) in subtitle operations that modify
	text (i.e., lowerCase(...) or breakLines(...) methods).

subtitleline:
	provides access to the ErrorFlag enum values, used to specify errors bits in
	error manipulation methods on both Subtitle and SubtitleLine classes.

debug:
	contains three functions (information, warning and error) that can be used
	while debuging scripts

Using these modules you can access objects to do pretty much anything the main
application can do. Included are some basic examples showcasing some of the
things you can do. If you have other scripts you consider worth sharing then send
them to me and I'll consider them for inclusion with the program.
